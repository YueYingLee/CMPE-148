## Overview 
This project is a simple web application **(3C1S)** with a user-friendly interface design that uses socket programming to create a way for users to communicate with each other over a local network at a minimum. At its core, it functions similarly to existing chat applications such as Messenger and Discord. Users would be able to create accounts and send or receive messages to and from other users. Our project will cover communication within a local network. Our application consists of two main components: client and server. The client component is made using HTML and JavaScript and provides the user with an easy-to-use front-end interface. The server component uses Python, Flask, and MySQL wrapped with SQLAlchemy to process and retrieve user data. The client and server communicate through the use of the socketIO library. Furthermore, our MySQL database is hosted online with Amazon Web Services (AWS).
